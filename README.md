#install from bashHistory
---
Script will read **.bashHistory** and whatever installed previously with syntax `sudo apt install` it will ask the user to install it or not.
Helpful when there's something went wrong with the linux that even with timeshift you can't recover it and you have to reinstall it again with all the application you installed before.
*It will just make your life easy when installing the application as you don't have to remember or read through your bashHistory line by line(coz it will big enough to frustrate you in no time*
**TimeShift the .bashHistory or backup it before reinstalling the new linux**

>read the code and modify it if your installing source command is different from the above mentioned
